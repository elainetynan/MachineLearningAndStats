Tasks
-----

Task 1 completed. Using Newtons method to get the square root of a value.

Task 2 completed. Using Chi-Square Tests method to see whether there is any evidence of an association between drink preference and biscuit preference.

Task 3 completed. Perform a t-test on the famous penguins data set to investigate whether there is evidence of a significant difference in the body mass of male and female gentoo penguins.

Task 4 completed. Using the iris data set, suggest whether the Setosa class is easily separable from the other two classes using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

Task 5 completed. Perform Principal Component Analysis on the iris data set, reducing the number of dimensions to two. Explain the purpose of the analysis and your results.


Project
-------

Project on Classification Algorithms using the Iris flower dataset.

Supervised Learning and Classifications algorithms are explained.

Plots of all characteristics are done to show that the Setosa Iris flower is linearly separable to the other two Iris flowers, and that the Virginica and Versicolor Iris flowers are not separable from each other.

The following classifications have been analysed:
 - K-Nearest Neighbors
 - Support Vector Classification
 - Na√Øve Bayes classifier
 - Random Forest Classifier
 - Logistic Regression Classifier
 - Decision Tree Classifier
 - Neural Network Classifier

Principal component Analysis was applied to the iris dataset and the resulting dataset was used by the Neural network Classifier to check the accuracy of the classifier on the 'summarised' data.

Synthesised data was generated, and this data was classified using the Random Forest Classifier.
